廣寒殿記   明宣宗撰

紀錄彙編卷之七

御製廣寒殿記

宣德

北京之萬歲山在宮城西北隅周廻數里而崇倍之皆奇石積
疊以成巍巍乎矗矗乎巉峭峻削盤廻起伏或陡絕如壑或巖
巖如屋左右二道宛轉而上步躡屢息乃造其巔而飛樓複閣
廣亭危榭東西拱向頫仰輝映不可殫紀最高者為廣寒殿崇
棟飛檐金鋪玉砌重丹疊翠五彩煥焉軼雲霞納日月高明闓
爽而北枕居庸東挹滄海西挾太行嵩岱並立乎前大河橫帶
于中俯視江淮一目無際寰中之勝槩天下之偉觀莫加於此
矣永樂中朕嘗侍  皇祖太宗文皇帝萬機之暇燕遊於此從
容之頃  天顏悅懌指顧山川而諭朕曰此古軒轅所都而後
來趙宋之彊境也宋弗良于行金取而都之金又弗良元取而
都之元之後裔不存殷鑒加弗良焉  天鑒我  太祖高皇帝
聖德命之弔伐用誕安天下天下既定  高皇帝念前故都也
簡於諸子以命我奠茲一方我惟夙夜敬勵不敢怠寧以仰副
  高皇帝付託之重暨建文嗣位信用姦回戕劉宗室舉四方
全盛之師加我于時茲城孤立殆一髮引干鈞矣賴  天地
宗廟之祐獲以城之孱弱羸老安其危而存其覆又因以清姦
憝奠  社稷而至于今日夫山川猶昔也昔之人以否德而失
之  高皇帝以大德而得之我承藉  高皇帝克艱難而保存
之奈何其可忘慎德又顧茲山而諭朕曰此宋之艮嶽也宋之
不振以是金不戒而徙於茲元又不戒而加侈焉睹其處思其
人夏書所為儆峻宇彫牆者也肆吾始來就國汰其侈存其槩
而時游焉則未嘗不有儆于中昔唐九成宮太宗亦因隋之舊
去其泰侈而不改作時資燕游以存監省汝將來有國家天下
之任政務餘閒或一登此則近而思吾之言遠而不忘聖賢之
明訓國家生民無窮之福矣朕拜稽受命無時或忘書不云乎
皇祖有訓詩不云乎儀刑文王肆嗣位以來凡事  天愛民一
體  皇祖之心敬而行之洞洞屬屬罔間夙夜比登茲山顧視
殿宇歲久而陁遂命工修葺永念  皇祖儼如在上敬以所授
大訓筆而勒諸樂石既以自省亦以昭示我子孫於億萬年
